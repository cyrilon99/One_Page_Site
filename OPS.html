            <p id="inText">Here we are considering the adverse effects of high intensity wildfires on the community and the environment.
            It should be remembered that it is not just intensity of a bushfire that matters. The extent of a bushfire is 
            also very important. A large bushfire can cause multiple direct impacts: on life and property, on the survival 
            of fauna populations, on water resources, and indirectly on government budgets and insurance costs. A large 
            bushfire will also generate huge amounts of smoke.<br/>

                <p id="ExtraInfo">
                    The changing weather patterns resulting from climate change have led to a significant increase in the Fire Danger Index (FDI) across Australia, particularly accelerating since the late 1990s, as indicated by studies (The Climate Institute, 2016). Projections suggest that by 2050, in comparison to the weather conditions between 1980 and 1999, the number of extreme fire weather days is expected to increase by 10 to 50 percent with low greenhouse gas emissions growth, and by 100 to 300 percent if a higher greenhouse gas emission scenario persists (The Climate Institute, 2016). This indicates a growing risk of bushfires due to climate change.
